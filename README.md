- Magazine-style "Key Prices" layouts with brand attribution
- Seamless integration with moodboard inspiration
- Professional editorial formats

### ðŸ“Š Project Management (Access-Controlled)

**Project Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - *Requires Authentication*
- Comprehensive project analytics and metrics
- Task management and team collaboration  
- GitHub integration and code quality tracking
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Role-based access control (Coming Soon)
